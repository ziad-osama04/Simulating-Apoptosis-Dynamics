# Python Libraries Required for the Apoptosis ODE Solvers Project
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# To install all libraries, run the following command in your terminal:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

numpy
# Core library for numerical operations, especially array manipulation.
# Used by: All numerical solvers (Euler, RK4, RKF45) and for data handling.


matplotlib
# Fundamental library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
# Used by: All scripts that generate and save graphs.


scipy
# Powerful library for scientific and technical computing.
# Used for: The high-accuracy baseline solvers (like BDF or LSODA via solve_ivp).


torch
# A deep learning framework from Facebook AI Research.
# Used by: The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) solver for building the
# neural network, automatic differentiation, and training.


pandas
# A data analysis and manipulation tool.
# Used by: Scripts that export results to CSV files (optional, but good practice).
